This Repo has the code to generate the SymSim data, Scapy clustering workflow for 20k genes(there are other itterations of the code for PCA pipelines and different datasets but are not on github) and how the alpha_mean values were generated. 

The code was run on DTU HPC.

And all the plots generated.
